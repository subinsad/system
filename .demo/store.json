Usage: pnpm store <command>

Reads and performs actions on pnpm store that is on the current filesystem.

Commands:
      add <pkg>...         Adds new packages to the store. Example: pnpm store
                           add express@4 typescript@2.1.0
      path                 Returns the path to the active store directory.
      prune                Removes unreferenced (extraneous, orphan) packages
                           from the store. Pruning the store is not harmful, but
                           might slow down future installations. Visit the
                           documentation for more information on unreferenced
                           packages and why they occur
      prune --force        If there are alien directories in the store, this
                           command removes them. Alien directories are
                           directories/files that were not created by the
                           package manager.
      status               Checks for modified packages in the store. Returns
                           exit code 0 if the content of the package is the same
                           as it was at the time of unpacking
