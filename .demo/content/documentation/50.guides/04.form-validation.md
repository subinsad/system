## Form validation

Form validation is a way to check if the data entered by the user is valid. Tairo provides a simple way to validate forms using the `vee-validate` and `zod` libraries.

Vee-validate provides vue components and composable to control fields and form whereas zod is a library to define schemas. In the example below, we show how both work with Tairo with a simple user profile form.

Note that you can totally remove those dependencies, Tairo and Shuriken UI components won't be affected.
